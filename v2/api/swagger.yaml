  description: "# Overview\n\nJumpCloud's V2 API. This set of endpoints allows JumpCloud\
    \ customers to manage objects, groupings and mappings and interact with the JumpCloud\
    \ Graph.\n\n## API Best Practices\n\nRead the linked Help Article below for guidance\
    \ on retrying failed requests to JumpCloud's REST API, as well as best practices\
    \ for structuring subsequent retry requests. Customizing retry mechanisms based\
    \ on these recommendations will increase the reliability and dependability of\
    \ your API calls.\n\nCovered topics include:\n1. Important Considerations\n2.\
    \ Supported HTTP Request Methods\n3. Response codes\n4. API Key rotation\n5. Paginating\n\
    6. Error handling\n7. Retry rates\n\n[JumpCloud Help Center - API Best Practices](https://support.jumpcloud.com/support/s/article/JumpCloud-API-Best-Practices)\n\
    \n# Directory Objects\n\nThis API offers the ability to interact with some of\
    \ our core features; otherwise known as Directory Objects. The Directory Objects\
    \ are:\n\n* Commands\n* Policies\n* Policy Groups\n* Applications\n* Systems\n\
    * Users\n* User Groups\n* System Groups\n* Radius Servers\n* Directories: Office\
    \ 365, LDAP,G-Suite, Active Directory\n* Duo accounts and applications.\n\nThe\
    \ Directory Object is an important concept to understand in order to successfully\
    \ use JumpCloud API.\n\n## JumpCloud Graph\n\nWe've also introduced the concept\
    \ of the JumpCloud Graph along with  Directory Objects. The Graph is a powerful\
    \ aspect of our platform which will enable you to associate objects with each\
    \ other, or establish membership for certain objects to become members of other\
    \ objects.\n\nSpecific `GET` endpoints will allow you to traverse the JumpCloud\
    \ Graph to return all indirect and directly bound objects in your organization.\n\

    # API Key\n\n## Access Your API Key\n\nTo locate your API Key:\n\n1. Log into\
    \ the [JumpCloud Admin Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com/).\n2. Go to the\
    \ username drop down located in the top-right of the Console.\n3. Retrieve your\
    \ API key from API Settings.\n\n## API Key Considerations\n\nThis API key is associated\
    \ to the currently logged in administrator. Other admins will have different API\
    \ keys.\n\n**WARNING** Please keep this API key secret, as it grants full access\
    \ to any data accessible via your JumpCloud console account.\n\nYou can also reset\
    \ your API key in the same location in the JumpCloud Admin Console.\n\n## Recycling\
    \ or Resetting Your API Key\n\nIn order to revoke access with the current API\
    \ key, simply reset your API key. This will render all calls using the previous\
    \ API key inaccessible.\n\nYour API key will be passed in as a header with the\
    \ header name \"x-api-key\".\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"x-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY_HERE]\"\
    \ \"https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systemgroups\"\n```\n\n# System Context\n\

    \nJumpCloud System Context Authorization is an alternative way to authenticate\
    \ with a subset of JumpCloud's REST APIs. Using this method, a system can manage\
    \ its information and resource associations, allowing modern auto provisioning\
    \ environments to scale as needed.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n * The following documentation\
    \ applies to Linux Operating Systems only.\n * Systems that have been automatically\
    \ enrolled using Apple's Device Enrollment Program (DEP) or systems enrolled using\
    \ the User Portal install are not eligible to use the System Context API to prevent\
    \ unauthorized access to system groups and resources. If a script that utilizes\
    \ the System Context API is invoked on a system enrolled in this way, it will\
    \ display an error.\n\n## Supported Endpoints\n\nJumpCloud System Context Authorization\
    \ can be used in conjunction with Systems endpoints found in the V1 API and certain\
    \ System Group endpoints found in the v2 API.\n\n* A system may fetch, alter,\
    \ and delete metadata about itself, including manipulating a system's Group and\
    \ Systemuser associations,\n  * `/api/systems/{system_id}` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_get)\
    \ [`PUT`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_put)\n\
    * A system may delete itself from your JumpCloud organization\n  * `/api/systems/{system_id}`\
    \ | [`DELETE`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/1.0/index.html#operation/systems_delete)\n\
    * A system may fetch its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)\n  * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/memberof`\
    \ | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembership)\n\
    \  * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsList)\n\
    \  * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/users` | [`GET`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemTraverseUser)\n\
    * A system may alter its direct resource associations under v2 (Groups)\n  * `/api/v2/systems/{system_id}/associations`\
    \ | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemAssociationsPost)\n\
    * A system may alter its System Group associations\n  * `/api/v2/systemgroups/{group_id}/members`\
    \ | [`POST`](https://docs.jumpcloud.com/api/2.0/index.html#operation/graph_systemGroupMembersPost)\n\
    \    * _NOTE_ If a system attempts to alter the system group membership of a different\
    \ system the request will be rejected\n\n## Response Codes\n\nIf endpoints other\
    \ than those described above are called using the System Context API, the server\
    \ will return a `401` response.\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo allow for secure access\
    \ to our APIs, you must authenticate each API request.\nJumpCloud System Context\
    \ Authorization uses [HTTP Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00)\
    \ to authenticate API requests.\nThe HTTP Signatures sent with each request are\
    \ similar to the signatures used by the Amazon Web Services REST API.\nTo help\
    \ with the request-signing process, we have provided an [example bash script](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh).\
    \ This example API request simply requests the entire system record. You must\
    \ be root, or have permissions to access the contents of the `/opt/jc` directory\
    \ to generate a signature.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the example script with explanations.\n\
    \nFirst, the script extracts the systemKey from the JSON formatted `/opt/jc/jcagent.conf`\
    \ file.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nconf=\"`cat /opt/jc/jcagent.conf`\"\nregex=\"\
    systemKey\\\":\\\"(\\w+)\\\"\"\n\nif [[ $conf =~ $regex ]] ; then\n  systemKey=\"\
    ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"\nfi\n```\n\nThen, the script retrieves the current date in\
    \ the correct format.\n\n```bash\nnow=`date -u \"+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT\"\
    `;\n```\n\nNext, we build a signing string to demonstrate the expected signature\
    \ format. The signed string must consist of the [request-line](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-35)\
    \ and the date header, separated by a newline character.\n\n```bash\nsignstr=\"\
    GET /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\\ndate: ${now}\"\n```\n\nThe next step\
    \ is to calculate and apply the signature. This is a two-step process:\n\n1. Create\
    \ a signature from the signing string using the JumpCloud Agent private key: ``printf\
    \ \"$signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key``\n2. Then Base64-encode\
    \ the signature string and trim off the newline characters: ``| openssl enc -e\
    \ -a | tr -d '\\n'``\n\nThe combined steps above result in:\n\n```bash\nsignature=`printf\
    \ \"$signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc -e\
    \ -a | tr -d '\\n'` ;\n```\n\nFinally, we make sure the API call sending the signature\
    \ has the same Authorization and Date header values, HTTP method, and URL that\
    \ were used in the signing string.\n\n```bash\ncurl -iq \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/json\"\
    \ \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Date: ${now}\" \\\n \
    \ -H \"Authorization: Signature keyId=\\\"system/${systemKey}\\\",headers=\\\"\
    request-line date\\\",algorithm=\\\"rsa-sha256\\\",signature=\\\"${signature}\\\
    \"\" \\\n  --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}\n```\n\
    \n### Input Data\n\nAll PUT and POST methods should use the HTTP Content-Type\
    \ header with a value of 'application/json'. PUT methods are used for updating\
    \ a record. POST methods are used to create a record.\n\nThe following example\
    \ demonstrates how to update the `displayName` of the system.\n\n```bash\nsignstr=\"\
    PUT /api/systems/${systemKey} HTTP/1.1\\ndate: ${now}\"\nsignature=`printf \"\
    $signstr\" | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign /opt/jc/client.key | openssl enc -e -a\
    \ | tr -d '\\n'` ;\n\ncurl -iq \\\n  -d \"{\\\"displayName\\\" : \\\"updated-system-name-1\\\
    \"}\" \\\n  -X \"PUT\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"\
    Accept: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Date: ${now}\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization:\
    \ Signature keyId=\\\"system/${systemKey}\\\",headers=\\\"request-line date\\\"\
    ,algorithm=\\\"rsa-sha256\\\",signature=\\\"${signature}\\\"\" \\\n  --url https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/systems/${systemKey}\n\
    ```\n\n### Output Data\n\nAll results will be formatted as JSON.\n\nHere is an\
    \ abbreviated example of response output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"525ee96f52e144993e000015\"\
    ,\n  \"agentServer\": \"lappy386\",\n  \"agentVersion\": \"0.9.42\",\n  \"arch\"\
    : \"x86_64\",\n  \"connectionKey\": \"127.0.0.1_51812\",\n  \"displayName\": \"\
    ubuntu-1204\",\n  \"firstContact\": \"2013-10-16T19:30:55.611Z\",\n  \"hostname\"\
    : \"ubuntu-1204\"\n  ...\n```\n\n## Additional Examples\n\n### Signing Authentication\
    \ Example\n\nThis example demonstrates how to make an authenticated request to\
    \ fetch the JumpCloud record for this system.\n\n[SigningExample.sh](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/shell/SigningExample.sh)\n\
    \n### Shutdown Hook\n\nThis example demonstrates how to make an authenticated\
    \ request on system shutdown.\nUsing an init.d script registered at run level\
    \ 0, you can call the System Context API as the system is shutting down.\n\n[Instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
    \ is an example of an init.d script that only runs at system shutdown.\n\nAfter\
    \ customizing the [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
    \ script, you should install it on the system(s) running the JumpCloud agent.\n\
    \n1. Copy the modified [instance-shutdown-initd](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/SystemContextAPI/blob/master/examples/instance-shutdown-initd)\
    \ to `/etc/init.d/instance-shutdown`.\n2. On Ubuntu systems, run `update-rc.d\
    \ instance-shutdown defaults`. On RedHat/CentOS systems, run `chkconfig --add\
    \ instance-shutdown`.\n\n## Third Party\n\n### Chef Cookbooks\n\n[https://github.com/nshenry03/jumpcloud](https://github.com/nshenry03/jumpcloud)\n\

    \n# Multi-Tenant Portal Headers\n\nMulti-Tenant Organization API Headers are available\
    \ for JumpCloud Admins to use when making API requests from Organizations that\
    \ have multiple managed organizations.\n\nThe `x-org-id` is a required header\
    \ for all multi-tenant admins when making API requests to JumpCloud. This header\
    \ will define to which organization you would like to make the request.\n\n**NOTE**\
    \ Single Tenant Admins do not need to provide this header when making an API request.\n\
    \n## Header Value\n\n`x-org-id`\n\n## API Response Codes\n\n* `400` Malformed\
    \ ID.\n* `400` x-org-id and Organization path ID do not match.\n* `401` ID not\
    \ included for multi-tenant admin\n* `403` ID included on unsupported route.\n\
    * `404` Organization ID Not Found.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/directories\
    \ \\\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'content-type: application/json'\
    \ \\\n  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \\\n  -H 'x-org-id: {ORG_ID}'\n\n```\n\n## To\
    \ Obtain an Individual Organization ID via the UI\n\nAs a prerequisite, your Primary\
    \ Organization will need to be setup for Multi-Tenancy. This provides access to\
    \ the Multi-Tenant Organization Admin Portal.\n\n1. Log into JumpCloud [Admin\
    \ Console](https://console.jumpcloud.com). If you are a multi-tenant Admin, you\
    \ will automatically be routed to the Multi-Tenant Admin Portal.\n2. From the\
    \ Multi-Tenant Portal's primary navigation bar, select the Organization you'd\
    \ like to access.\n3. You will automatically be routed to that Organization's\
    \ Admin Console.\n4. Go to Settings in the sub-tenant's primary navigation.\n\
    5. You can obtain your Organization ID below your Organization's Contact Information\
    \ on the Settings page.\n\n## To Obtain All Organization IDs via the API\n\n*\
    \ You can make an API request to this endpoint using the API key of your Primary\
    \ Organization.  `https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/` This will\
    \ return all your managed organizations.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \\\n  https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/organizations/\
    \ \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
    \ \\\n  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}'\n```\n\n# SDKs\n\nYou can find language specific\
    \ SDKs that can help you kickstart your Integration with JumpCloud in the following\
    \ GitHub repositories:\n\n* [Python](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-python)\n\
    * [Go](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-go)\n* [Ruby](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-ruby)\n\
    * [Java](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-java)\n"
